 # 🕵️‍♂️ The AI Detective Diaries: Cracking the Case of Biased Bots  

## 📖 Overview  
This project explores responsible AI by investigating two real-world scenarios where AI systems create unfair outcomes. Written in a blog-style format, it demonstrates how to analyze AI usage, identify potential risks, and propose responsible solutions.  

The focus is on **fairness, privacy, transparency, and accountability**—the pillars of trustworthy AI.

## 🗂️ Case Files  

### 🚨 Case 1: The Hiring Bot  
- **What’s happening:** A company uses AI to screen job applicants. It tends to reject more women with career gaps.  
- **Problematic because:**  
  - Bias in training data  
  - Unfair penalization of caregiving/personal breaks  
  - Lack of accountability and transparency  
- **Improvement:** Retrain with fairness constraints, include human oversight, and give candidates feedback.

### 🚨 Case 2: The School Proctoring AI  
- **What’s happening:** AI-powered exam proctoring flags students as “cheating” based on eye movements.  
- **Problematic because:**  
  - Neurodivergent students flagged unfairly  
  - Stress levels rise from over-surveillance  
  - No clear appeal process  
- **Improvement:** Use multiple signals (e.g., network activity, tab switching), require human review, and allow student appeals.

## 🧩 Key Takeaways  
- AI without fairness checks can punish people for being human.  
- Transparency, human oversight, and regular audits are essential.  
- The goal of AI should be to **support decisions, not replace human judgment.**

## 📌 How to Use  
- Share the blog content as an **awareness article** or **classroom discussion piece**  
- Adapt the case analysis format for other AI scenarios  
- Use as a template for writing about responsible AI in projects or research
